3. On Monitor app, schedule execution must show executions which are scheduled for future dates
8. On Monitor app, Executed test case but still it shows in Execution Schedule
9. On Monitor app, Executed test case but on execution details char it shows queued as 20
- When we add entry via Execute Test plan then schedule date is optional in that case how this is handled ? 
- All 3 above points are related to date, so seems like same issue.
